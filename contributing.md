## Guidelines

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this project.

- Use the `.editorconfig` file in your editor. This maintains a consistent style. Refer to the [website](https://editorconfig.org/) for more info.
- Format code using [stylua](https://github.com/johnnymorganz/stylua). This keeps everything consistent.
  - Make sure that the project's `stylua.toml` file is used for stylua settings.
- Run `make extragen` to update `extra`'s folder with changes.
  - If changes are made to palettes
  - If adding a new extra template add it to the list in `misc/extra.lua`
- Run `make docgen` if changes are made to `usage.md`.
  - Requires `pandoc` to be installed. If using `nix` there is a `devShell` in the `flake.nix`
- Run `make all` to execute the above make recipes.

- Create a topic branch on your fork for your specific PR.
- Consider using [conventional commits][concom] rules for creating explicit and meaningful commit messages.

  that explains the breaking change.
